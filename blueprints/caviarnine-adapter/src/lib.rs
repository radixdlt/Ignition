//! This crate and module implements the CaviarSwap adapter that is used by the
//! Olympus to translate high-level commands such as `open_liquidity_position`
//! and `close_liquidity_position` to lower level methods and function calls
//! that need to be made to the CaviarSwap components to achieve those higher
//! level intents.
//!
//! This is an adapter for Caviar's QuantaSwap blueprint which is the main
//! blueprint used in their concentrated-liquidity liquidity pools and the
//! one of interest to Olympus.
//!
//! Since CaviarNine follows Uniswap v3 concentrated liquidity approach this
//! makes this adapter implementation more complex than a Uniswap v2 style
//! liquidity pool such as that of Ociswap. This doc-string aims to document
//! and explain the logic that this adapter implements and also explain the
//! relevant portions of CaviarNine's model.
//!
//! First, in a concentrated liquidity market makers allow users to contribute
//! liquidity in a particular price range. Typically, the user does not have
//! complete control over what price range to contribute their liquidity to,
//! just some amount of control. To elaborate, each pool has discrete price
//! ranges, so, a user must provide their liquidity within the discrete price
//! ranges defined on the pool.
//!
//! CaviarNine uses the terms "Tick" and "Bin". A Tick is a discrete point in
//! price logarithmic space. A Bin holds liquidity for a discrete part of price
//! logarithmic space. A Bin's position is set by the Tick of it's lower bound.
//! The number of Ticks a Bin covers, and therefore it's upper bound is set by
//! the `bin_span` parameter of the pool.
//!
//! All pools always have exactly one active bin at all times; all other bins
//! are inactive. An important point to note is that when a bin is inactive:
//! * No trades go through it (when a bin is inactive, it means that the assets
//! are not being traded at the Bin's price).
//! * Since no trades go through inactive bins they do not earn fees while
//! inactive.
//! * An inactive bin is composed entirely of a single asset. The _only_ bin
//! that has two assets is the currently active bin.
//!
//! Aside from the glaring differences that exist between the concentrated
//! liquidity model and the uniswap v2 model, there are some other subtle
//! differences that should be highlighted and accounted for in the adapter:
//!
//! * One main difference between CaviarNine and a Uniswap v2-style DEX is that
//! a liquidity provider does not own a portion of the pool, they own a portion
//! of the bin that they added liquidity to.
//! * A user who wishes to add liquidity to non-active bins does not have to
//! contribute both of the assets, all that they need is one of them. Which
//! asset is needed depends on whether the bin being contributed to is above
//! or below the currently active bin.
//! * With the above point in mind, this leads us to a bid difference between
//! the two models: in uniswap-v2, a pool's value is split 50/50 between the
//! two assets if the market is efficient and prices are being constantly
//! arbitraged. However, in an efficient market, a CaviarNine's pool value may
//! or may not be split 50/50.
//!
//! This adapter tries its best to treat CaviarSwap almost as if it does not
//! have concentrated liquidity. So, the hope is to implement something that
//! adds liquidity in the ranges [0, âˆž]. However, this is not possible to do
//! as CaviarNine allows for a maximum of 200 positions in a receipt (an NFT),
//! in other words, we can add liquidity to a maximum of 200 price ranges. If
//! we wanted, we can work around that by providing liquidity multiple times,
//! but we do not do that for this adapter implementation.
//!
//! Since we can only provide liquidity to 200 bins, we provide liquidity to the
//! active bin, to 99 bins of ticks less than the active bin, and to 98 bins
//! with ticks more than the active bin, this totals up to 199 bins, which is
//! one less than the maximum we're allowed to contribute to. Liquidity will be
//! provided to these bins equally; meaning we will provide the `x` bins with
//! `amount_x / len(x)` bins, and the same for the other resource.
//!
//! As eluded to previously, inactive bins only hold one resource and not both.
//! Bins with ticks lower than that of the active tick only have the `y` asset,
//! and the opposite for the other side. So, the `x` resources will be divided
//! across 100 bins and the y resources will be divided across another 100 bins.
//!
//! The bin selection algorithm tries to select 199 bins with the currently
//! active bin in the center, 98 lower bins, and 98 higher bins. However, there
//! are certain cases when this is not possible such as cases when the active
//! bin is skewed in one direction or another. In such case, the algorithm tries
//! to compensate on the other non-skewed side and attempts to get us 98 lower
//! and 98 higher. In cases when the bin span is too large, it is possible that
//! we get less 199 bins.
